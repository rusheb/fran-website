Hello, nice to meet you. I'm Fran.
In the world we live in, it's very normal to Google people—especially someone you're going to talk to about something as important as mental health. It makes sense to want to know a bit about them. So I’ve written this for anyone who might be working with me, or thinking about it.

You might be reading this as a family member or friend of someone who’s experienced psychosis, or perhaps you’re someone who’s experienced unusual or distressing experiences yourself and are attending family sessions with your loved ones.

I'm a qualified social worker, trained in mental health, and have been working with people experiencing psychosis for over five years. I’ve worked in both local council and NHS settings, offering individual therapy, family work, and peer support groups—like Hearing Voices groups and sessions for friends and family.

Most of my week is spent with families, doing family sessions. I also offer one-to-one support to carers and family members. I'm a qualified Cognitive Behavioural Family Intervention for Psychosis (CBFI-p) therapist. CBFI-p means having regular sessions with your family—usually every couple of weeks, for around 14 weeks. I use this step-by-step way of working in my sessions with families, train others to deliver it, and I'm currently training to support new CBFI-p therapists through supervision.

I choose to do this work because there’s strong evidence that family sessions can reduce relapses, lower hospital admission rates, and support better recovery. More than that, I’ve seen how much it helps families to feel more connected, supported, and understood.

A little more about me…
I became a mental health social worker because of my own experiences and those of people close to me. I’m always learning—I’m currently studying for a foundation in systemic psychotherapy at the Tavistock.

Outside of work, I love cycling (though my bike was recently stolen, so you may see me walking for now!). I love a good cup of tea and a chocolate biscuit, enjoy 60s music, and relaxing in the bath with candles. On weekends, you’ll often find me at car boot sales looking for hidden treasures.

Family Sessions for psychosis have a strong [evidence base](/evidence/) for reducing relapse and promoting recovery.
